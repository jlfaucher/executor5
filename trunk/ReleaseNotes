Note
====
ooRexx 4.1.1 is a bug fix only release.  There are no new features or
enhancements in this release.  This, mostly empty, file is left as a
template for future release.

Fixed bugs are listed in the CHANGES document.

File List
=========
Linux rpm and deb packages contain the distribution name and version of
the system they were built on.  For instance,
ooRexx-4.1.0-beta1.opensuse1110.x86_64.rpm was built on OpenSuSE 11.1.

Pick the package closest to the system you intend to install on.  If the
package is not an exact match and will not install, or the interpreter will
not run because of a conflict with the C / C++ libraries, it may be possible
to get one of the developers to build a package for your system by opening
up a support request in the tracker system.  Note that developer resources
are constrained and this is neither a commitment nor a promise.

Installation and Configuration
==============================

Prior to Installation:
----------------------

Important: An "upgrade" type of installation is neither tested nor supported
on any platform.  Please completely uninstall a prior version of ooRexx
before installing a new version.  Installing over the top of an existing
installation is likely to produce unpredictable results.

For installation help and other relevant notes, prior to installation,
please read the "ReadMe.pdf" PDF file which is placed with the downloadable
files for this release on SourceForge.

A Note on Linux packages:
-------------------------

The generically named rpm packages should install on any modern distribution
that uses RPM as a package manager.  Likewise, the generically named deb
packages will install on any modern debian-based systems.

When it is known that the generic package has problems on a distribution,
the ooRexx team may build an additional package for that specific
distribution.  In which case, the installation package will have the
targeted distribution in its file name.

Please use the generically named rpm and deb packages.  If there is a
problem on your distribution, report it by opening up a Tracker bug.
Depending on resources, the ooRexx team may be able to build a specific
package for that distribution.
