    Return value
    Upon successful return, return the number of characters printed (not including the trailing '\0' used to end output to strings).
    The functions snprintf() do not write more than size bytes (including the trailing '\0').
    If the output was truncated due to this limit then the return value is the number of characters (not including the trailing '\0') which would have been written to the final string if enough space had been available.
    Thus, a return value of size or more means that the output was truncated. (See also below under NOTES.)
    If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

    Conforming To
    The snprintf() function conform to C99.
    Concerning the return value of snprintf(), SUSv2 and C99 contradict each other:
    when snprintf() is called with size=0 then SUSv2 stipulates an unspecified return value less than 1,
    while C99 allows str to be NULL in this case, and gives the return value (as always) as the number of characters that would have been written in case the output string has been large enough.

    Notes
    The glibc implementation of the functions snprintf() conforms to the C99 standard, i.e., behaves as described above, since glibc version 2.1.
    Until glibc 2.0.6 they would return -1 when the output was truncated.
