When changing the version number of ooRexx you will need to change the following files:

oorexx.ver
configure.ac
rexutils/rxftp.cls
platform/unix/oorexx.spec.in
platform/unix/rexx.1
platform/unix/rexxc.1
platform/unix/rxmigrate.1
platform/unix/rxqueue.1
platform/unix/rxsubcom.1
CHANGES

When the library interface changes you need to modify the oorexx/oorexx.ver
file. BE CAREFUL!!!!! This info has no relationship to the ooRexx package
version! If you don't know what you are doing, then don't do anything!
