/*
    This object interacts with its creator outside of the COM specification.  To handle
  this complication a pointer to a bool flag is passed on the constructor.  If the
  pointer is defined, this object interacts with its creator by writing to the FILE*
  passed as the first parameter of the constructor, and by setting the bool pointed to
  by the third parameter to true in the constructor, and false in the destructor.
  The bool is a signal to the creator about the existence of this object.  It is
  important to the creator in making the decision to Release(), or not.
    Not all of the users of this object act in the typical COM tradition.  The typical
  COM usage assumes that when a pointer is given to a caller, that the giver performs
  an AddRef(), and the receiver performs a Release() when done.  When the refcount
  goes to 0, the object is destroyed.  It has been noted in some cases that upon
  receiving a pointer to this object, the receiver did not all assume a refcount had
  been added, and the receiver performed an AddRef().  Thus when they were done, the
  Release() brought the count back to the point where the receiver obtained a pointer
  to the object, and the object did not go away.  In these cases, the creator must
  perform the additional Release().
    The bool flag that resides in the creators address space, informs the creator if
  the object still exists.  There is a special Release(), UDRelease(), that tells the
  object to cease the extra interactions.  The creator is gone.
    The creator calls UDRelease() if it is done with the object, and the object still
  exists. Example:

  HRESULT     hResult=S_OK;
  OrxScriptError *ErrObj;
  bool        ErrObj_Exists;

      ErrObj = new OrxScriptError(logfile,condData,&ErrObj_Exists);
      hResult = pEngine->getScriptSitePtr()->OnScriptError((IActiveScriptError*) ErrObj);
      if (hResult == E_UNEXPECTED) {
      }
      // init to empty again....
      if(ErrObj_Exists) ErrObj->UDRelease();


  NB:  There is a potential problem.  An assumption is being made based on passed
  behavior.  If this changes, so that the receiver acts as other COM objects, the
  code through the flag will adjust for this, unless the receiver expects the life
  of the object to persist passed what we assume it should be.
