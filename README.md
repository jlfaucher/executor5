Experimental ooRexx5
===================
Forked from http://sourceforge.net/projects/oorexx/

- main/trunk

The goal of this repository is to apply to ooRexx5 the same changes that were applied to ooRexx4 ([Executor][executor]),
except those for m17n (too many impacted files).

Miscellaneous notes:

- [JLF diary][jlf_diary]
- [Internal notes][internal_notes]
