//   Wrapper class that hides the linked list holding the NamedItems.
// named item class: stores a named item including the flags with
// which it was added.
//
//    There are two types of items that this list stores.  One is a named item
//  that was passed to the engine through IActiveScript::AddNamedItem().  The
//  other is a subitem that belongs to one of the named items.  Example: Using
//  the Internet Explorer as the host, it will add "window" as a named item.
//  Later, the code might ask if there is a "document" named item.  The answer is
//  "No, there isn't, but.... "window" knows "document"".  So "document" is
//  added to the list as a subitem.
//    In the named item list, these are distinguished by the DispID field of the
//  NID (NAMEDITEM_STRUCT).  For items added through the IActiveScript method,
//  the DispID is -1.  For subitems added, the DispID will be anything other
//  than -1.

  //    A special LinkedList class, NILList (Named Item Linked List), was created for OrxNamedItem.
  //  The NILList::DropContent() has been made a friend, so that it can have access to the
  //  NAMEDITEM_STRUCT, which is necessary for it to perform the ->Release() on the interfaces
  //  it is holding, before freeing the structure to global memory.  A more Object Oriented
  //  friendly solution would be to provide an OrxNamedItem method to do this, however,
  //  this scheme seemed more efficient.

  //    This entry point is called directly from AddNamedItem().  Therefore, it saves an
  //  item (not a subitem).  The DispID is forced to -1.  The wide character is required
  //  in the parameter list.  It is how we get the name from AddNamedItem(), and how
  //  GetIDsOfNames() wishes to see the name.  Therefore, to avoid needless conversion
  //  overhead, the wide charatecter set is passed.

  //    This is called by the engine when a name is encountered during
  //  execution that needs resolution.  All of the known names are checked
  //  first.  If found, the appropriate information is copied from the NID.
  //  if not found, the list is scanned, and each Item entry is asked if it
  //  knows the name in question.  If so, then the internal AddItem() is
  //  called to add the subitem to the list.  Otherwise, an error is returned.
  //    The subitem inherits the IDispatch of the item that knows it.  The
  //  flags of the Item are not replicated with the SubItem.  0 is sent
  //  instead.

  //  DISP_E_UNKNOWNNAME             -1     Not a valid/known name
  //
  //    Currently, this does not query a subitem to see if it supports the
  //  IDispatch interface.  Therefore, only Items, not SubItems are queried
  //  to see if a name is known.
