Installation and Configuration
==============================

Prior to Installation:
----------------------

Important:  An "upgrade" type of installation is neither tested nor
supported on any platform.  Please completely uninstall a prior version of
ooRexx before installing a new version.  Installing over the top of an
existing installation is likely to produce unpredictable results.

For installation help and other relevant notes, prior to installation,
please read the "0ReadMe.pdf" PDF file which is placed with the
downloadable files for this release on SourceForge.

A Note on Linux packages:
-------------------------

The generically named rpm packages should install on any modern
distribution that uses RPM as a package manager.  Likewise, the
generically named deb packages will install on any modern debian-based
systems.

When it is known that the generic package has problems on a distribution,
the ooRexx team may build an additional package for that specific
distribution.  In which case, the installation package will have the
targeted distribution in its file name.

Please use the generically named rpm and deb packages.  If there is a
problem on your distribution, report it by opening up a Tracker bug.
Depending on resources, the ooRexx team may be able to build a specific
package for that distribution.
