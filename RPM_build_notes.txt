                       Notes on Building an ooRexx RPM
                       ===============================

The configure script, makefile and RPM spec file are all set up to build the
ooRexx RPM in the user's HOME subdirectory in a subdirectory named rpmbuild.

    ~/rpmbuild

The RPM build tree will be created in that location.

    ~/rpmbuild/BUILD
    ~/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT
    ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
    ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
    ~/rpmbuild/RPMS

The build process first attempts to remove the entire ~/rpmbuild tree if it
exists. It then recreates the tree before the rpmbuild command is actually
executed. The result RPM(s) will be placed in this tree and this tree will
be used for all build steps.

                          Building a Suse ooRexx RPM
                          ==========================

On Suse there is an additional step that has to be performed prior to
executing the rpmbuild command. You need to create the file .rpmmacros
in your home subdirectory and place the following in it:

    %_topdir /home/dashley/rpmbuild
    %_mandir /usr/man

The above is just an example. You need to replace the /home/dashley
string with your HOME subdirectory. DO NOT attempt to use the tilde (~)
to specify your HOME subdirectory as the tilde will not be expanded
to your HOME subdirectory. The %_mandir line should be left as shown.

These changes are absolutely necessary on a SLES or openSuse system
use to build an ooRexx RPM.

You should also be aware that the RPM built on a Suse system will NOT
install correctly on a Fedora/Red Hat system as the location of the
man dir is different on these systems.

If these steps do not work for you please open a Bug Report on the ooRexx
SourceForge web site. Be sure to include any error messages that are
available to help us debug the problem.
