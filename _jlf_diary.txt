ooRexx5 has too many changes, compared to ooRexx4.
Not possible to merge the changes for ooRexx5 into the Github repository Executor.
Hence the creation of a new Github repository Executor5...

Creation of the Github repository Executor5.
Procedure :
Using SmartGit, clone svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main (svn)
Add the remote git@github.com:jlfaucher/executor5.git (origin)
Push svn to origin

Remember, don't use
svn+ssh://jfaucher@svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main
to avoid any accidental update of SVN repository.

Attempt to reclone because the history of revisions has a "hole" before rev 10464 "promote sandbox version to trunk".
But... see below, does not work.
Not a big problem, I can stay like that.
I keep the procedure, for the records.

Follow the procedure described here :
https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/howtos/5/show?page=config.svn-clone-custom-branch-layout
because ooRexx SVN repository has not a standard branch layout.
Repository, Clone.
Check the box "Just initialize clone".
Click finish.
-->  The repository is in state <incomplete>
Close the repository.
Edit the file .git/svn/.svngit/svngitkit.config
Replace the section [svn-git-remote "svn"] by :
[svn-git-remote "svn"]
	url = svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main/trunk
	fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/svn/trunk
    branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/svn/branches/*
    tags = releases/*:refs/remotes/svn/releases/*
    additional-branches = "sandbox/rick/*:refs/remotes/sandbox/rick/*"
[svn-git-remote "svn"]
	url = svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/oorexx/code-0/main
	fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/svn/trunk
	branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/svn/branches/*
	tags = releases/*:refs/remotes/svn/releases/*
Reopen the repository in SmartGit.
Remote, Pull, Fetch only (rebase).
--> Display "Fetch".
When done, the repository is still in state <incomplete>.
Again : Remote, pull
--> Display "Restarting clone", and work in background (you see the progression in the bottom bar).
and... BOOM !
Repository is inconsistent (remote reference "refs/remotes/svn/branches/4.1 corresponds to SVN
remote "svn", but has no fetched SVN commit).
Please reclone the repository from scratch.
