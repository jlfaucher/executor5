                       Notes on Building an ooRexx RPM
                       ===============================

The configure script, makefile and RPM spec file are all set up to build the
ooRexx RPM off the user's HOME subdirectory in a subdirectory named rpmbuild.

    ~/rpmbuild

The RPM build tree will be created in that location.

    ~/rpmbuild/BUILD
    ~/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT
    ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
    ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
    ~/rpmbuild/RPMS

The build process first attempts to remove the entire ~/rpmbuild tree if it
exists. It then recreates the tree before the rpmbuild command is actually
executed. The result RPM(s) will be placed in this tree and this tree will
be used for all build steps.

On some RPM-based systems there is an additional step that has to be performed
prior to executing the rpmbuild command. You need to create the file .rpmmacros
in your home subdirectory and place the following in it:

    %_topdir /home/dashley/rpmbuild

The above is just an example. You need to replace the /home/dashley
string with your HOME subdirectory. DO NOT attempt to use the tilde (~)
to specify your HOME subdirectory as the tilde will not be expanded
to your HOME subdirectory. The .rpmmacros file may or may not be needed
but it is safer to go ahead and create one. You will know that you need it
if you get an error at the very end of the build and it complains that you
have no access to the target build tree.

You should also be aware that RPMs may not be portable accross all Linux
RPM-based distributions. This is particurally true when you are trying to
install on an older distribution that does not fully comply with the Linux
Filesystem Standard.

If these steps do not work for you please open a Bug Report on the ooRexx
SourceForge web site. Be sure to include any error messages that are
available to help us debug the problem.
