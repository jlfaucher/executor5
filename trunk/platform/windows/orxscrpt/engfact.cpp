#define INITGUID        /*  The invocation of <initguid.h> have been removed.  That
                           header always defined the macro DEFINE_GUID() to generate
                           an initial value, so if the macro was in a header that
                           was included by all of the programs, then the linker
                           freaked out due to redefinitions.  Using the default
                           macro that comes with <basetyps.h> only a reference to
                           the GUID will be generated, no initial value.
                           This will cause the DEFINE_GUID() macro to generate the text
                           of the macro instead of a reference.
