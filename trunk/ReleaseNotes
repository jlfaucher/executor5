Note
====
ooRexx 4.1.0 is a bug fix and enhancement release.  The new
features and enhancements are listed below.

File List
=========
Linux rpm and deb packages contain the distribution name and version of
the system they were built on.  For instance,
ooRexx-4.1.0-beta1.opensuse1110.x86_64.rpm was built on OpenSuSE 11.1.

Pick the package closest to the system you intend to install on.  If the
package is not an exact match and will not install, or the interpreter
will not run because of a conflict with the C / C++ libraries, it may be
possible to get one of the developers to build a package for your system
by opening up a support request in the tracker system.  Note that
developer resources are constrained and this is neither a commitment nor
a promise.

Installation and Configuration
==============================

Prior to Installation:
----------------------

Important:  An "upgrade" type of installation is neither tested nor
supported on any platform.  Please completely uninstall a prior version of
ooRexx before installing a new version.  Installing over the top of an
existing installation is likely to produce unpredictable results.

For installation help and other relevant notes, prior to installation,
please read the "0ReadMe.pdf" PDF file which is placed with the
downloadable files for this release on SourceForge.

A Note on Linux packages:
-------------------------

The generically named rpm packages should install on any modern
distribution that uses RPM as a package manager.  Likewise, the
generically named deb packages will install on any modern debian-based
systems.

When it is known that the generic package has problems on a distribution,
the ooRexx team may build an additional package for that specific
distribution.  In which case, the installation package will have the
targeted distribution in its file name.

Please use the generically named rpm and deb packages.  If there is a
problem on your distribution, report it by opening up a Tracker bug.
Depending on resources, the ooRexx team may be able to build a specific
package for that distribution.

Windows Installation:
=====================

Major changes
-------------

1.)  There is a new 'type' of install ('upgrade'). The upgrade installation
is only active if there is a previous version of ooRexx installed.

An upgrade removes only the files from the previous version and
installs the files for the current version.  It does not change any of
the existing registry or environment settings.  They stay exactly the
same.

Since the uninstaller is written at the time of installation, the
upgrade install is only available if the version of the uninstaller is
4.1.0 or later.  What this means in practice is, the first time you
install a 4.1.0 ooRexx, the upgrade install will not be available
because the previous installation wrote an uninstaller that does not
understand the upgrade type.

When you do an upgrade install you can not change any of the settings
from the previous install.  I.e., if you installed in
C:\MyCrummyDirectory\ooRexx then the upgrade also installs in that
directory.  If you installed rxapi as a service in the previous
install, then it remains installed as a service.  Etc., etc..

2.)  The installation lets associate file extensions with the ooRexx
executables. Default values are :
Executable      Extension      ftype (File type)
rexx.exe        .rex           RexxScript
rexxhide.exe    .rexg          RexxHide
rexxpaws        .rexp          RexxPaws

A 'Send To' item can be defined for rexx.exe, rexxhide.exe and
rexxpaws.exe.

An editor for the edit context menu can be defined (the same editor
is used for all ooRexx file types).

Minor changes
-------------

1.) Rather than put up a message box about stopping rxapi, a page
is displayed. That way there is more room to explain why rxapi needs
to be stopped. If the user elects to not stop rxapi, the installer quits.

2.) The message box popup with the question about uninstalling the
previous version is turned into a page.  This makes it easier to
insist that the user uninstall the previous version and explain that
if she chooses not to uninstall the previous version it is likely to
cause problems and that we won't support that.  It is made more
difficult for the user to not uninstall a previous version, there is a
second check box that has to be manually checked.

3.) During the uninstall, the user is given the option of uninstalling
by simply deleting the installation directory or only deleting the
files placed there by the installer using the log file.  Using the log
file is the default.  Uninstalling by deleting the whole installation
directory is generally faster than using the install log.

4.) The installation user interface is meant to be more modern, meant
to explain better to some one new to the install of ooRexx on Windows
what they should do and why, and meant to allow some one used to
installing a quicker uninstall / install cycle.
