  - The rxapi daemon has been enhanced to support distributions that
    support the systemd daemon control mechanism. The ooRexx installation
    automatically detects the kind of daemon control system supported by
    the Linux distribution and dynamically picks the best one to use.

  - The rxapid script has been upgraded to be LSB compliant.
