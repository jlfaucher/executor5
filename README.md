Experimental ooRexx5
===================
Forked from [https://sourceforge.net/p/oorexx/code-0/HEAD/tree][sourceforge]

- main/trunk

The goal of this repository is to apply to ooRexx5 some of the changes that were applied to oorRexx4 ([Executor][executor]).
A very low priority on my todo list.

Miscellaneous notes:

- [JLF diary][jlf_diary]
- [Executor internal notes][internal_notes]
- [Instructions to build Executor5 from scratch][build_executor5]
