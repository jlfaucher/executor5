<!---
  ---     This example shows how easy it is to
  ---  invoke a COM object that is a script using
  ---  Object Rexx.
  ---
  ---     Before this sample will execute without errors,
  ---  the file, "SimpleObjectRexxCOM.wsc", must be
  ---  registered.  Please refer to the "Object Rexx
  ---  Reference" manual on how to do this.
