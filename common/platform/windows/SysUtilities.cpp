    Return value
    _vsnprintf returns the number of bytes stored in buffer, not counting the terminating null character.
    If the number of bytes required to store the data exceeds count, then count bytes of data are stored in buffer and a negative value is returned.

    Remarks
    The _snprintf function formats and stores count or fewer characters and values (including a terminating null character that is always appended
    unless count is zero or the formatted string length is greater than or equal to count characters) in buffer.
